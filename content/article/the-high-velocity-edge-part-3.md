Welcome to part three of my series on Steven Spear’s 2009 book [The
High Velocity Edge][book]. Part two introduced the four capabilities
through Alcoa’s commitment to changing their safety culture. Today,
I’ll cover how a single man embodied the four capabilities decades
before they were practiced at Alcoa.

This man is Admiral Hyman Rickover of the US navy’s nuclear propulsion
program; also known as "NR", short for nuclear reactors. Rickover
launched the program and built a culture that sustains to this day.
The story begins in 1949 at the dawn of the nuclear age

The US navy wanted nuclear powered submarines. The nuclear capability
meant that allowed subs to remain submerged virtually indefinitely and
cover much larger areas. The challenge was nuclear reactors were an
entirely new technology. No one understood how to take nuclear energy
out of bombs and put it safely into submarines.

The engineers had to figure everything out from scratch. That’s just
what they did. The program launched the first nuclear powered sub just
five years later

NR also accomplished this with an exemplary safety record when
compared to the USSR. NR has had zero reactor related causalities and
zero radiation escapes. For comparison, he USSR had more than 10
before their collapse in 1991

The program’s success traces back to Rickover establishing a high
velocity culture. The culture begins with the first capability:
capturing the best collective knowledge and making problems visible.
This was especially important for NR, since everything was unknown
territory.

Rickover led his team in the discipline of engineering: the approaches
necessary of managing the design, operation, and improvement of
complex systems for great benefit when they run well, and for great
consequence when they fail.

Categorizing the system into "understood" and "not understood" was
central part to the discipline of engineering. Here’s a story about a
nuclear shielding experiment that demonstrates the concept

Sensors were laid over the test material. Engineers were asked to
predict señor readings ahead of time. Engineers were expected to give
specific numbers, not just if it would pass the mandatory threshold

If the shielding underperformed expectations then that required
additional investigation and experiments. On the other hand, if the
shielding outperformed expectations, then that revealed something that
was not understood. In this case, this unexpected outcome could be
fatal. So experiments would repeat until engineers could predict the
outcome ahead of time. Only then did they truly understand the problem

These experiments and results made it into detailed reports about
assumptions, expectations, and outcomes. Rickover also required
reports include analysis of alternate explanations and dissenting
assessments. This demonstrated the line between certainty and
uncertainty. Or in other words, areas that tested the boundaries
between "understood" and "not understood".

Writing such detailed reports was not a bureaucratic exercise

Rickover put it: "Nothing so sharpens the thought process as writing
down one’s arguments. Weaknesses overlooked in oral discussions
rapidly become painfully obvious on the written page.

This knowledge equipped engineers to swarm problems and convert
knowledge from "not understood" into "understood"

NR relied heavily on physical models to expose problems in the
man-machine system. These models allowed fast and cheap tests while.
They also exposed participants to reactors at the earliest possible
point. Today, we call this a "shift left"

Every shipboard reactor had a matching training reactor on land. Each
land based reactor had matching full scale wooden and cardboard
mockups. These models and mockups ensured that sailors and engineers
had prior exposure to the system before manning the submarine

This was key because Rickover could not be on the submarine with the
crew. Crews needed to be autonomous. The entire NR process had to be
portable such that new crews could achieve the same outcomes as those
leading the program. In other words, he had to scale out

NR leveraged written operating procedures for nearly every aspect of
daily work. Every experiment, every new bit of knowledge was
integrated into the standard operating procedures. These procedures
represented the best knowledge NR had accumulated up to that point in
time.

That enabled crews to assume responsibility for an entire vessel. That
included its design, the operating procedures themselves,
troubleshooting and problem solving routines, and even training. All
this had already been proved out by NR. Crews just had to follow the
procedures

This approach is great for launching the first submarine. What about
the second or the tenth? What happens after Rickover eventually leaves
the program?

Well, Rickover modeled two different leadership behaviors. First is
thevision and goal setting. Rickover exemplified exellcence and pushed
others as well. The second is learner-in-chief. Rickover understood
that human knowledge is imperfect. Leaders must embrace this and
demonstrate how to continually perfect their knowledge for themselves
and for the larger organization

Then, scale that process by developing the same capabilities in
others. A colleague recounts wonderful story about just that

Rickover came to class on nuclear technology on behalf of the US navy
shortly after World War II. He kept asking the instructor to repeat
lessons in simpler terms. The class became restless as the new student
embarrassed himself. The instructor asked if Rickover would like
private tutoring on the topic. Uembarrassed by this, Rickover
accepted. When the session happened, it was not just Rickover and the
instructor. More people from the class showed up, even some of those
who sneered at him showed up. Rickover commented: "I guess I’m not
the only dummy in the class.

I love this story because it demonstrates the importance of asking for
clarification. I know what I’m about to say is oftenly repeated, but
the odds are if you have a question, then someone else the room does
too.

For whatever reason, they may be afraid to ask it or simply speak up.
Being a leaner-in-chief means accepting that your knowledge is
imperfect, then demonstrating how to move from "not understood" to
"understood"

I think Rickover is a fascinating character. I can wonder how much
grit and patience such an undertaking requires. The fact that they
were able to operationalize a new technology _and_ do it safely is
tremendous

I often think back to these programs and the early days of NASA. It
truly astounds me how much they were able to accomplish and how much
they changed the world. I wonder if I channel some of that mythical
"right stuff" into my own work. It seems that Rickover had some of it.

This is evident in books about him. Listen to these titles: "Rickover
and the Nuclear Navy: The Discipline of Technology", "Rickover: the
struggle for Excellence", "The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made a
Difference". Here’s one I particularly like: "The Never Ending
Challenge of Engineering: Admiral H.G. Rickover in his own words"

Rickover understood that the end state was an illusion. Instead there
was only improvement

I’ll conclude this episode with a quote from Rickover that shows why
he had some of the right stuff

> The discipline of technology means that the organization must adapt
> to the technology and not the technology to the organization. For
> advanced development, data are never complete, particularly if the
> product of complex technology is to operate at high standards for

> laboratory or research centers, there is no reason to expect they
> are better known on the shop floor. The discipline of technology
> requires thorough and deep consideration of the match between the
> product and its use, and the intense analysis of the present and
> anticipated future conditions of operation

Alright, let’s leave Rickover here for now.

In the next episode, I’ll discuss how Taiichi Ohno and Sakichi Toyoda
pioneered the first capability: system design and operation.
