The original 12 factor app[^1]
states that applications should use the same versions of backing
services in development and production. Recall that a "Backing
Service[^2]" is any service
the app consumes over the network. Examples include datastores like
MySQL or Redis and external APIs like Amazon S3. The original 12
factor app guidelines for the "dev/prod" and "backing services"
factors mostly focus on datastores. This open the dev/prod factor to
interpretation regarding external APIs, which leads to wildly
different outcomes depending on the interpretation.

If you take the original guidelines at face value, then your
development environment will make network calls to the same versions
of backing services. That assumes all backing services are in fact
running and accessible. This is problematic for multiple reasons.

Consider a distributed system. Is it possible—ignoring whatever effort
that requires—to run all services in single development environment?
If so, does your hardware have the necessary compute resources to
support it? If not, then what’s the solution and how much parity
dev/prod parity is there as result?

Consider a third party API like Twitter. Is the development
environment going to make real tweets? If so, to which Twitter
account? Does each development environment need a separate twitter
account? If so, does that change the utility of the development
environment?

These examples show the added complexity in assuming that all backing
services are available in the development environment. In the best
case, it’s functional but fragile. In the worst case it creates a mess
of dependencies and loads that saddles the team with
toil[^3].
In my view, These outcomes come from the assumption that development
environments should be fully integrated environments masquerading
behind the banner of dev/prod parity.

The 12.1 factor app takes a different approach. The 12.1 factor app
strives for dev/prod parity where practical and eschews it when not.
This requires differenating between bounded and unbounded contexts.

A typical service uses a datastore and interacts with external
services. In this case the datastore is within the bounded context.
It’s assumed that service consumers will access data via an API
instead of accessing the datastore directly because doing so violates
the bounded context. In this case, achieving dev/prod parity is
practical and certainly useful. The service must be developed and
tested against the same version used in production. Tools like Docker
make it trivially easy to do, so there’s no argument to be made
against it.

This typical service also interacts with external services. These are
outside the bounded context because the service has no control over
them but is still dependent on them. The 12.1 factor app eschews
dev/prod parity for these backing services. These backing services
should not be used in development or test. They should be replaced
with mocks with tests and fakes in development. Mocks enable unit
tests of interactions at the boundary. Fakes in development promote
isolated environments and supports forcing the consumer through
behaviors which may not be possible in real environments.

Combining these two practices works well with a single service and
scales up to multiple services. The 12.1 factor approach prefers
locality[^4] over
fully integrated environments. Doing so promotes fast and independent
iterations on discrete services using automated tests to verify
correctness. End-to-End issues that may have been identified with a
fully integrated environment with dev/prod parity should be pushed
downstream in the deployment pipeline in accordance with test
pyramid[^5]
principles. If a regression is identified, then it may quickly
addressed by adding tests to the relevant service’s test suite.

These recommendations build on a substantial amount of prior knowledge like:

4. The [Hexagonal

   used to swap between mocks, fakes, and real versions of external
   services
5. How to grow production ready software guided by tests

Check the show notes for links on these topics. I hope this episode
has given you some food for thought on the goal of dev/prod parity and
its effects across the software development process.

That’s all for this one. Good luck out there and happy shipping.
