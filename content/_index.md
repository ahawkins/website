# About

This wiki began after I read [The High Velocity
Edge]({{< ref "book/the-high-velocity-edge" >}}).
The author tells a story of him going to work at Toyota factory. He
asks someone there how they do their particular job. I think it was
something along the lines of how they did their part on the automotive
assembly line. You may expect the worker demonstrated how to do the
task. That's not what happened.

Instead, the worker pulled out a binder. The binder contained all the
learnings and experiments they'd done that demonstrated the best
knowledge on hand about how to accomplish the task. While it is true
the worker knew how to accopmlish the task, more importantly there was
meta work happening. He knew how to learn how to accomplish the task.

This wiki is like that for me. It documents my understanding
on achieving software delivery performance sooner, safer, and
happier.
