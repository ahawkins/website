Hey, I'm Adam Hawkins, independent software consultant, trainer,
writer and speaker. My goal is **help teams deliver
software sooner, safer, and happier.** I think continuous delivery
paired with continuous improvement is the best way to do that.
DevOps.

I started my career as a full stack web developer. That taught me
sound software architecture principles and software engineering
practices like test driven development.

Over time I shifted focus on to backend services and infrastructure.
That lead me continuous deployment, production operations, SRE, and
ultimately to DevOps.

I currently work as an SRE at [Skillshare](https://skillshare.com).

On the personal side, I was born in the California Bay Area. I lived
abroad from 2011 to 2019 in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and India. I've
lived in Hawaii with my wife since 2019. My hobbies include travel,
trance, coffee, and the ocean.
