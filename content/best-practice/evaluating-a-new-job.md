title = "Evaluating a New Engineering Job"
+++

My friend and I recently discussed things to consider when choosing a
new engineering job. My criteria assess the general organization and
technical status. I think it’s extremely important to always move to a
better gig, and sometimes it is worth it make a lateral move if there
is more future potential.

I have written up a few areas that should be considered before
accepting a new position. Each is a sliding scale. A decision should
be made on the aggregate and not one one specific factor. Lastly I
compiled a list of easily identifiable red flags.

## Continuous Delivery Capability

I think continuous delivery is the best way to build software and
internet products. There are many different ways to assess an
organization’s position. The matrix lists easily identifiable signs.
The organization should be at least in “Managed” in most of the areas.
This is a great way to assess an organization’s confidence in their
process and what it is like to ship software on a day-to-day basis.
Generally the organization should have a positive trajectory and is
moving to the right in all areas.

## Organizational Impact Capacity

Its important to consider how much impact your work has. “Impact” is
subjective. It may be a direct change in revenue, or doing something
to improve the situation for your coworkers, it may even be driving
the organization in a specific direction. Regardless, each person must
define their own impact criteria and consider their role.

## Growth Potential

This should be evaluated in two directions. First, what opportunities
does the position provide to grow my career? Second, how far can I
grow in an organization? The first one is more important because each
person much come up with their own expectations on what they can
achieve and where they want to go professionally. The second question
helps to judge how much can be achieved in the given position.

## Culture Fit

Each of us have our own personality and values. It is entirely
possible that your values may conflict with the attitudes of others.
Consider this scenario: you stop work after a given hour to have your
personal time, however many others work around the clock and are upset
when you do not. Culture fit is difficult to asses but it contributes
so much to your overall happiness in an organization.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s)

It cannot be improved unless it is measured. Numbers encourage
transparent decisions around facts. They also align everyone on what
is important. You should evaluate how the organization measure itself
and it’s members. KPI’s should be clear and relatable.

## Immediate Red Flags

Usually it is easier to recognize what you do not want. We have all
been burned by various things and we remember them well. There is also
our personal preferences and various engineering/culture fit things.
Here are some reasons I would reject potential employment. Personally
I have no interest in working with a company that meets any of these
criteria. I do have the capacity to help improve these areas but I do
not want to spend my time and energy building up these areas.

1. **No source control.** Yes, this still happens. If the company does
   not have source control, then they are working in an entirely
   different problem space.
2. **No continous integration.** Simple, if there is no CI, then there
   is no tests. If there are no tests then everything is completely
   and utterly doomed.
3. **Manual and infrequent releases.** Humans are horrible at
   following instructions. Manual deploys create more headaches than
   they solve. To me this indicates the organization does not have
   means to automate or do not see the benefit. I do not know which
   one is worse.
4. **No interest in the product.** The company may be a product
   company. If I have no interest in using or do not see the value,
   then there is no point in contributing my time and effort.
5. **Remote work is outlawed.** It is fine if the company does not
   embrace the “remote first” philosophy since there are many well
   thought out reasons not to. However if a company has fully come out
   against remote work on principal then count me out.
6. **Significant technical debt.** This is difficult to gauge compared
   to the others. It relates to the organization’s overall technical
   health. I am not interested in working in an engineering department
   that has two hands tied behind their back.
7. **No engineering blog.** I am extremely interested in learning
   about how the organization approaches, solves problems, and
   generally about the act of engineering at the organization. I
   cannot educate myself without this. I do not like going in blind.
8. **Uninteresting tech.** I have reached a point where I know there
   is stuff I simply do not want to put up with on a day to day basis.
   The top of mind items are: closed source platforms, Java, C,
   Golang, C, and C++. One important rule for myself is: “if the
   languages requires me to write map myself, then I will ignore that
   language.” There are plenty of more appealing options. There are
   also frameworks (Rails) that I do not want to deal with as primary
   job requirements.
9. **No KPIs.** Organizations need numbers to measure their success.
   These numbers must be built into the process. When the organization
   does not have any defined then it indicates there is a poor
   decision making process.
10. **Cheapness.** There is a difference between frugal and cheap.
    Provide me appropriate hardware. It’s 2016, SSD’s are entirely
    affordable now. Do not penny pinch me over such details. Save
    money where it makes sense. Buying cut rate hardware and other
    tools is fantastic way to alienate me. Do not try to stiff me on
    pay either. It is a big market out there.
11. **No educational focus.** I can educate myself on topics I am
    interested well enough. However there are things that are purely
    related the business’s technology stack or problem domain. Invest
    in me and there will be a return. Help me to help you.
12. **No metrics.** “It’s not in production until it is monitored.” A
    system cannot be monitored without metrics. Monitoring can be a
    really tricky nut to crack, but if there is not any data on the
    system’s operational state then count me out.
