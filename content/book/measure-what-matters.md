OKR is short for objectives and key results. Objectives are high level
goals. Key results are measurable way points to achieving objectives.
I’ve encountered OKRs in my professional life and in the conversation
around software and business development. John Doerr’s [_Measure What
Matters_](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation-ebook/dp/B078FZ9SYB/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
makes the case that OKRs drive business success, align individuals and
teams, and are a continuous improvement driver. Moreover, OKRs open
the door to new organizational and management structures suited to
modern business.

## Background

_Measure What Matters_ is born from John Doerr’s time at Intel with
Andy Grove. Andy Grove is a famous executive known for leading Intel
and [pioneering management
techniques](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679762884/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0679762884&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2).
OKRs are one such technique. If you’re unfamiliar with the history
behind OKRs, then it’s important to understand the author is not the
inventor. The [OKR origin
story](https://www.whatmatters.com/stories/the-origin-story) is
credited to Andy Grove and Operation Crush. Operation Crush was
Intel’s plan to absolutely crush their competitor Motorola and achieve
market dominance. It worked, and here we are today.

John Doerr expands on Andy Grove’s legacy with the case for OKRs as
told by himself and others. _Measure What Matters_ is divided into two
parts. Part one covers OKR history, fundamentals, relation to business
success, and organization structure. Part two introduces a new
management model based on CFRs (Conversations, Feedback, Recognition),
OKRs, and continuous improvement.

The book feels like a labor of love and somewhat of an offering to
Andy Grove. Andy Grove mentored John Doerr during his early career.
Doerr deeply respects Grove. His zealousness and infinity comes out in
the text. _Measure What Matters_ is Doerr’s attempt to spread Grove’s
message of defined, transparent goals, accountability, and continuous
improvement with a wider audience.

## Thoughts

People are more likely to achieve their goals when they write them
down. If you agree, then _Measure What Matters_ will not surprise you.
The book will strengthen that position and provided a framework for
achieving larger goals and growing businesses.

If you’re unfamiliar with goal setting, then _Measure What Matters_
offers a zero-to-one understanding on the importance of goal setting,
its relationship to organization structure, and how to build business.
OKRs have the super powers to focus, align, track and stretch.

Here’s Doerr on each super power:

> Superpower #1 — High-performance organizations home in on work
> that’s important, and are equally clear on what doesn’t matter. OKRs
> impel leaders to make hard choices. They’re a precision
> communication tool for departments, teams, and individual
> contributors. By dispelling confusion, OKRs give us the focus needed
> to win.

> Superpower #2 — Align and Connect for Teamwork: With OKR
> transparency, everyone’s goals — from the CEO down — are openly
> shared. Individuals link their objectives to the company’s game
> plan, identify cross-dependencies, and coordinate with other teams.
> By connecting each contributor to the organization’s success,
> top-down alignment brings meaning to work. By deepening people’s
> sense of ownership, bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovation.

> Superpower #3 — Track for Accountability: OKRs are driven by data.
> They are animated by periodic check-ins, objective grading, and
> continuous reassessment — all in a spirit of no-judgment
> accountability. An endangered key result triggers action to get it
> back on track, or to revise or replace it if warranted.

> Superpower #4 — Stretch for Amazing: OKRs motivate us to excel by
> doing more than we’d thought possible. By testing our limits and
> affording the freedom to fail, they release our most creative,
> ambitious selves.

Each chapter in part one focuses on one of the superpowers. My
favorite chapters were on stretch goals — I especially like the
chapter on YouTube’s 1 billion watch hours. It’s a testament to the
OKRs aligning a team and pushing them to achieve more than they
thought possible.

_Measure What Matters_ made me question my experience at my previous
company. The company had a process to document and assess goals.
Employees would suggest goals oriented with improving their team KPIs
(Key Performance Indicator). I lead the SRE team. Infrastructure
operating cost was one of our KPIs. I’d set goals to drop this KPI by
a certain percentage. Then my reports would set goals according to
mine in a top-down fashion. The approach failed because decisions did
not revolve around the goals. The goals were formalized, rarely
accomplished, and works towards them conceded to other organizational
forces. This reads like a few stories in part one. There are plenty of
stories of organizations struggling to adopt OKRs and how they
eventually succeeded. My lesson here is that organizations must go
full-throttle on adopting OKRs to reap the full benefits — and that
must start with the highest levels of management.

This train of thought connected the relationship between KPIs and
OKRS. My gut reaction to “KPIs” is negative because my previous
company called their goal setting process “KPIs”. KPIs are not
discussed in the book, but they are discussed in many other management
books. KPIs are just numbers, but they’re related to OKRs. In fact,
the names are self-evident: Key Results and Key Performance Indicator.
Thus, KPIS determine key results, or as _Measure What Matters_ puts it
“as measured by”. Here’s an example.

* **Objective: Extend runway by one year**
* Key Result: Lower staffing costs by 50,000 by Q2
* Key Result: Reduce monthly operating cost by 10% by Q2
* Key Result: Renegotiate lower deals with three vendors by Q2

This example extends runway by lowering operating costs. The objective
drives the key results as measured by cost KPIs. My previous company’s
approach was the other way around. Objectives were set to move KPIs
but were not really connected with larger objectives. In a nutshell,
KPIs quantify key results, but are not objectives. Don’t mistake them
for that.

Part 2 advocates for changing organizational structure and HR based on
continuous improvement through CFRs and OKRs. The new structure uses
fast feedback cycles between a manager and a report based on OKRs.
That should empower individuals to hit their key results and achieve
their objectives. Processes like annual performance reviews become
outdated.

This approach effectively applies the three DevOps principles to
people management. That also kicked off an internal discussion of
where else the principles of flow, feedback, and improvement may be
applied. I wrote John Doerr an email about this. Also, thanks to John
Doerr for putting his email directly in the text and soliciting
feedback. Here’s the relevant text from that email:

> Roughly speaking, DevOps frames successful IT with three ways: The
> Principle of Flow — fast flow from development to production; The
> Principle of Feedback — fast flow from production to development, so
> information from production can be integrated as quickly as
> possible; The Principle of Continuous Improvement — focused
> improvement through data and experimentation across all processes.
> The principle of continuous improvement is analogous to the Toyota
> Way which you may be familiar with.Your call for a new approach for
> modern work is analogous to the DevOps transformation across the IT
> industry. The industry doesn’t do waterfall anymore. We release
> frequently and in small batches. The same thing is happening to HR.
> The move from annual review to quarterly or faster is analogous to
> the first way. The OKR’s and CFRs is the data required to course
> correct, or the second way. Applying OKR’s and CFR’s to the goal
> alignment process is continuous improvement. I agree with your
> position as well. It’s no surprise that organizations are changing
> their processes.

I didn’t expect to make a connection between DevOps, nor did I read
the book for DevOps things. However, I did spark a discussion on what
OKRs teams should use to improve their IT performance.

## Highlights and Notes

> “OKRs make you focus on working on the business, instead of just
> working in the business.”

This is my favorite quote because it clarifies the real superpower.
OKRs done right will advance the business. Other approaches may keep
you treading water.

> OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and
> coordination. They link diverse operations, lending purpose and
> unity to the entire organization.

Sometimes it’s difficult to distinguish the forest from the trees. We
get bogged down in sub goals. Setting objectives and stretching to
reach them reveal true intentions.

## Recommendation

I recommend _Measure What Matters_ to anyone in a leadership
position — especially those in organizations struggling with goal
setting. VPs and C level employees will do well to read this book. You
don’t need to be in a large company to take something away from the
book. The book begins with the story of applying OKRs in a small
startup called Google. In fact, people in small organizations will
find more value in this book because it provides a framework for
building culture. Establishing culture is far easier to do earlier
rather than later.

_Measure What Matters_ is an easy read. I enjoyed learning the history
behind some companies and tales from leaders on the inside as they
strive to meet their goals. I think anyone in leadership could relate
to the stories in the book. Beyond that, the appendix includes
material for assessing and applying OKRs in your company.

Or, you can go straight to the TED talk.

I recommend you pass on the book if you’re already familiar with OKRs
and Andy Grove’s management approach. The book may contain new
anecdotes, but I doubt they’re fundamentally altering.
