The book targets enterprise CXOs trying (or struggling, or failing) to
transform their business with IT.

## Napoleon, Risk, Lean, and DevOps

_War and Peace and IT_ is peppered with Napoleon references. The
Battle of Borodino is the most important. Napoleon sat upon a hill far
removed from the battle. The (literal) fog of war obscured his vision
of the battlefield. Nevertheless, he passed orders down the chain of
command assuming the orders would make a difference. However that
wasn't the case. His orders were already outdated by the time they
reached the frontline because the on-the-ground conditions at changed.
Schwarz argues that this is akin to the core problem in the
traditional view of "Business & IT" where businesses simply expect IT
to delivery irrespective to high amount of uncertainty and changing
conditions.

Schwarz argues this model (he refers it as "contractor-control") is
detrimental to business success. This model increases the risk that
IT—and thus the business—will fail to achieve business  outcomes.
Moreover, it decreases organization agility which critical "-ility" in
today's digital world. The author's thesis rests on the definition of
"risk", so there's any entire chapter dedicated to discussing "risk"
in the contractor-control model and Lean/DevOps/Agile model.

The traditional contractor-control model focuses on projects and
planning. The business specifies exactly what to build and throws it
over the wall to IT for complete, on-time, and on-budget delivery. So
business and IT departments toil away to deliver some semblance of
what was originally requested resulting in disappointment and
frustration for all involved. The "risk" in this model is that
projects don't complete, do not deliver all the requirements, or run
over budget. However, there is no risk associated with business
outcomes because the projects were never about them in the first
place. If you're familiar with arguments for DevOps related to the
competing concerns of development and operations, then you'll find
Schwarz's argument similar just one level up the org chart (business
vs IT instead compared to development vs operations).

Schwarz argues the contractor-control model is risky because it
increases the likelihood that work does not deliver business outcomes.
It may also put another way. The digital world makes stasis risky. A
competitor may release a new product and take the market. A start-up
may disrupt the market and negate your entire business model. The
safest course of action in today's digital world is promote agility.

_War and Peace and IT_ argues businesses must be able to adapt and
iterate quickly otherwise they're dead in the water. Businesses must
change their relation to IT. IT is a core competency that drives
business outcomes. The book shifts into why and how to apply DevOps,
lean, and agile methods after establishing this position. The book
concludes with two chapters of prescriptive solutions for businesses
and leadership.

## Key Points

* Agility is the best way to reduce risk and handle uncertainty in
  today's digital age
* Use lean theory backed by DevOps for successful businesses
* Focus on business outcomes instead of functional requirements
* Judge individuals and teams on their progress towards business goals
* Focus on organizational lead times (the time from idea to
  production)
* Use staged investments as a form of project management
* Push actions down the chain of command driven by strategic
  objectives
* Use automated controls for compliance (i.e. shift left on security)
* Optimize for work not-done by eliminating waste
* Create cross-functional teams dedicated to achieving business
  outcomes ## Digital Transformation Prescription

Here's the doctor's orders for organizations in the early stages of a
digital transformation.

### Tie IT Initiatives to Business Outcomes

First, identify a business objective such as 20% increase in signups.
Then assemble a cross-functional business/IT team. This team must be
fully capable of achieving the outcome without outside help. Strive
for a lean process (i.e. remove waste) that's simple, fast, and
inexpensive. Managers and leaders outside the team should remove
impediments such as change controls or other bureaucracy. Don't start
by reorganizing all teams. Start small and grow from there. Remember
small, fast, and inexpensive iterations apply to all things.

### Shorten Lead Times

> Lead time is the time from when the organization conceives of an
> objective to the time that it is met.

Ideal lead times are short. Apply lean theory to eliminate waste and
wait times in your process. Use DevOps to speed up software
development value stream. Leverage cloud infrastructure over physical
infrastructure. Automate compliance and other controls. Communicate
with everyone the goal isn't to work more or harder. The goal is
improve workflow.

### Emphasize Delivery and Results

> The only measure of progress in the digital land is finishing things
> that add business value.

The goal is "always be shipping". This value stream is the company's
heart beat. Break tasks down into smaller chunks, finish it, observe,
and repeat. Ask what can we deliver in two weeks? If the response is
"that's impossible" then flip the script to "how can we make it
possible?" There's always way to improve the IT value stream.

### Treat Requirements as Hypotheses

> The enterprise must stop thinking of its ideas as requirements to be
> given to IT. Instead, it must treat its ideas as hypotheses about
> what will accomplish business goals.

Consider a requirement like "display data X". This requirement assumes
"X" delivers some business outcome. Don't assume that. Craft a small
experiment to confirm the hypothesis and take it from there. Sample
experiments may be adding a button that displays "X" and presents the
user with a coming soon message. Tracking the clicks indicates the
desire for such a feature. You may also use A/B testing to test
hypotheses. Subsequent experiments increase the likelihood that the
changes deliver the expected business outcome.

## Quotes

> The good news is that today’s IT techniques give companies the
> agility, nimbleness, and speed they need to do just that.
> Enterprises using the cloud, along with the set of practices known
> as DevOps, can deploy IT capabilities to customers and employees
> hundreds of times a day—rather than once every six months—and can do
> so reliably, securely, compliantly, and at a high level of quality
> and usability.

This quote is from early in the text. It describes what modern looks
like. Better yet, it dispels the misconceptions about the duality of
"speed vs safety". Today, IT is moving more quickly and safely than
ever before and providing more business value.

> A Microsoft study found that only one-third of ideas actually
> accomplish their intended objective; another one-third have the
> opposite result, and one-third don’t have either effect. Yet a
> requirements document includes all three thirds.

Scary stuff right? This quote makes the point for lean theory.
Businesses must avoid this by focusing exclusively on business
hypothesis, then keeping those that work and scrapping those that
don't.

> The task of [complex adaptive system] leaders isn't to issue orders,
> but to put in place conditions that will cause independent actors
> within it to choose behaviors that will lead to the right outcomes.

Businesses are [CAS (complex adaptive
systems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system).
Schwarz is alluding to concepts in [The Toyota
Kata][toyota kata] about how managers
and leaders should act. Hint, they don't decide but teach others
closer to the on-the-ground problem how achieve the best outcomes.

> Agile and Lean IT come together in the set of practices called
> DevOps. It's the technical approach I recommend you follow in
> digital transformation, and is used successfully today by
> enterprises across virtually all industries—Capital One, Nike,
> Target, John Deere, Disney, to name a few. It’s based on
> cross-functional teams (to avoid handoffs between IT specialties)
> and heavy use of automation to streamline processes and make them
> repeatable. DevOps is powerful for businesses because of its
> approach to speed and control—it effectively does away with the
> tradeoff that formerly existed between the two.

This quote is just a nice summary of DevOps and how it helps
businesses.

> The real risks are (1) the risk of not accomplishing our business
> objectives, and (2) the risk of not accomplishing them in the
> quickest, most cost-effective way. To those I'll add (3) the risk of
> unintentionally exceeding the budget. Cost, schedule, and scope are
> at best only proxies for these real concerns.

This quote explains the real risks associated with IT projects. Note
that they're focused on business objectives—\_not\_ requirements.

> When a new idea is proposed, instead of managing its risk by
> thinking of all of the things that could go wrong, remember that we
> can manage it by running small "experiments" that will teach us
> whether the idea will work, or how the idea needs to change to make
> it workable.

How many times have you been in this situation? Note the shift away
from risk towards hypothesis validation.

## My Thoughts & Recommendation

_War and Peace and IT_ felt similar to Mik Kersten's [Project to
Product][]. Both books approach the problem of business and IT in
slightly different ways. _Project to Product_ focus on the value
stream throughout the organization. The book argues that businesses
must adopt a product based approach over the project approach. _War
and Peace and IT_ makes a case for moving away from project based
thinking (the contractor-control model) to a lean model with
integrated IT. _Project to Product_ recommends something similar but
spends more time discussing the value steam and ultimately proposes
metrics to asses the entire value stream. _Project to Product_'s early
chapters discuss the important of digital transformation and the risk
associated with not doing so. _War and Peace and IT_ make similar
arguments then focuses on leading transformations. I think Schwarz's
arguments around risk are better than Kersten's.

Both books cover the same area but have different target audience.
Schwarz' calls this out in the preface. _War and Peace and IT_ is
primarily for CXO of enterprise organizations curious about digital
transformation. If you're a CXO who likes ideas, a few practical
examples, and advice than _War and Peace and IT_ is the book for you.
Also, if you're not too familiar with the idea of Agile, Lean, and
DevOps but keen to kick start a digital transformation then _War and
Peace and IT_ is a great jumping off point into other topics.

If you're more numbers oriented, then [Project to
Product][] is a better bet.
Personally, I'd read _Project to Product_ then use the last two
chapters of _War and Peace and IT_ as an action plan to get started.

I don't think engineers should spend their time on this book since it
targets CXO and management types. A engineer's time is better suited
with more inside-IT or engineering focused view like the [The DevOps
Handbook][], [Accelerate][], or even [Project to Product][].

If you're already onboard the DevOps, Lean, and agile train then I
don't think there's anything new in this book for you. Odds are you're
already following the advice in the last two chapters.
