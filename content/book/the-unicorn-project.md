## The Story of Parts Unlimited

I discussed this book and the prequel [The Pheonix Project][] on my
podcast. This episode tells the story of Parts Unlimited through Bill
& Maxine's eye. It weaves together both The Pheonix Project and The
Unicorn Project into a single story.

Parts Unlimited is the fictional company described in both books.
Bill, the main character in The Pheonix Project, tells the story from
the management and operation side. Maxine, the main character in The
Unicorn Project, tells the story from a front line developer's
perspective.
