_The High Velocity Edge_ (referenced as THVE) is one of the best books
I've read. It introduced me to lean thinking, defined kanban, the
powerful _jidoka_ concept, and led me to discover Dr. Deming.

The book introduces the four capabilities of high velocity
organizations:

1. System design and operation
2. Problem solving
3. Knowledge sharing
4. Developing skills one, two, and three in others.

I presented the book in [nine part series][series] on this website and
on my [podcast][]. The podcast series concludes with an interview with
author, Dr. Steven Spear.

## Summarized

"High velocity" out learn the competition with scientific thinking and
continuous improvement. Basically, they apply the scientific method
everywhere, to everything, all the time.

[Part one][] tells the story of Mrs. Grant. Mrs. Grant is a real life
hospital patient who died in treatment. Who's fault is that? Spear
argues that no one person is responsible. The _system_ that created
the conditions that allowed a patient to die is responsible.

[Part two][] describes how Paul O'Neil, the CEO of Alcoa, changed the
safety culture by leveraging the four capabilities. His story
demonstrates that great systems are not designed. They are discovered.

[Part three][] introduces Admiral Hyman Rickover who create the US
Navy's nuclear propulsion program. He was able to operationalize a
brand new technology (nuclear reactors) and establish a lasting culture.

[Part four][] teaches philosophy that originated from two pivotal
figures in manufacturing history: Sakichi Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno.
Sakichi Toyoda founded Toyota. Taiichi Ohno transformed manufacturing
while working at Toyota. Taiichio Ohno invented "pull based" work and
Kanban. Toyoda gave us _jidoka_.

[Part five][] explains the first capability, system design and
operation, through building
pull-based systems that use jidoka to identify problems when and where
they occur.

[Part six][] continues discussing the first capability through four
levels of system design: output, pathway design, connection design,
and methods of individual activities.

[Part seven][] explains the second capability, problem solving, by
using scientific thinking to close the gap between the current
condition and the ideal target condition.

[Part eight][] demonstrates the third and fourth capabilities,
knowldede sharing and teaching others, through the _jishuken_ (or
"self-study") exercise.

[Part nine][] wraps with a summary and my closing thoughts.
