## Quick Summary

The book discusses the 14 principles behind the "The Toyota Way". [The
Toyota
Way](http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/conditions/philosophy/toyotaway2001.html)
was formally introduced by Fujio Cho, then CEO, in 2001. Each chapter
explains a principle with examples and stories of real life work at
Toyota. The principles describe how Toyota became a learning
organization and a world leading manufacturer.

## The Toyota Way House

"The Toyota Way" (the concept, not the book) may be visualized as a
house with two pillars. One pillar is continuous improvement, or
_kaizen_. Challenge everything. Learn. Explore. Discover. The second
pillar is respect for people. Toyota believes its people can rise to
any challenge and equips them with the philosophy and organizational
support to do so.

![2001 Toyota Way House](/images/toyota-way-2001-house.jpg)

The book breaks The Toyota Way down into fourteen principles
categorized by the 4Ps: Philosophy, Process, People, and Problem
Solving.

The fourteen principles overlap with the four capabilities (system
design, problem solving, knowledge sharing, teaching others)
introduced in [The High Velocity Edge][thve]. They’re also directly
influenced by Dr. Deming since he worked extensively with Toyota.
Also, the second edition of this book was updated to factor in Mike
Rother’s work in [The Toyota Kata][]. If you’re familiar with these
books or listened to the previous [Small Batches][] episodes, then
you’ll feel right at home with these principles. In fact, they may not
even be a surprise.

I’ve paraphrased the principles a bit to better fit this format.

## Philosophy

**Principle one: Adopt systems thinking**. Take a
long-term view and focus on the entire end-to-end value stream. Do not
prioritize short term results. [^1]

[^1]:
    This is straight out of Deming’s [The New Economics][] and
    system of profound knowledge. This should be no suprise since Deming
    worked extensively with Toyota and other Japanese companies.

## Process

**Principle two: design systems for flow and identifying
problems**. The key to this principle is the
second part. Systems need built in mechanisms to surface problems.
That’s the first step in solving them. [^2]

[^2]:
    See "capability one: system design and operation" from [The High
    Velocity Edge][thve]. Capability one groups _The Toyota Way_
    principle one, two, three, four, and five.

**Principle three: use pull based systems**. "Pull" in the
Toyota Way means the ideal state of just-in-time manufacturing: giving
the customers what they want, when they want it, and in the amount they
want. This is the foundation for all future lean-esque processes. [^3]

[^3]:
    This is also discussed in-depth in [The High Velocity
    Edge][thve] under capability one: system design. See my article on
    [pull][part 4]. The idea comes from the legendary Taiichi Ohno.

**Principle four: level the workflow to create flow**. Toyota
calls this _heijunka_. The idea is manage incoming work to meet demand
and ensure minimal interruptions. Unleveled work creates waste by
underutilizing resources or overburdening them. Level the work, then
just-in-time begins to take on meaning.

**Principle five: standardize work as the foundation for
continuous improvement**. Continuous improvement, or _kaizen_, only
works if there is a baseline. Standardizing work means codifying the
best way to do something as it's currently understood. "Currently" is
the operative word in that sentence.

**Principle six: stop and fix problems when they occur**.
This is follow up to principle two. Stop and fix problem as early as
possible in the process. Toyota's [Andon cord][] is an example. [^4]

[^4]:
    See "Capability Two: Problem Solving" from [The High Velocity
    Edge][thve]. This goes hand-in-hand with _jidoka_ or the practice of
    automatically detecting defects and other failure senarios.

**Principle seven: use visual control to support decision making and
problem solving**. A picture is worth a thousand words. Human beings
strongest sense is The visual sense. Leverage that. Display the state
of the system and processes in useful visuals so people can quickly
asses the situation and make necessary adjustments .

**Principle eight: smart humans with robot friends**. Toyota
uses technology to support its people and processes. They do not
introduce technology for technology's sake. They tend to be a bit
behind the adoption curve but that’s OK for them.

## People

**Principle nine: grow leaders who understand the work, live the
philosophy, and teach it others.** Toyota leaders are coaches. They
deeply understand systems thinking, continuous improvement, and
dedicated practice. Their job is teach others do the same. [^5]

[^5]:
    See "Capability Four: Develop High Velocity Skills in Others"
    from [The High Velocity Edge][thve]. Also refer to [The Toyota Kata][]
    for more on leaders as coaches.

**Principle ten: develop people and teams who follow the
company philosophy**. Toyota needs people who can follow the
principles and internalize the culture.

**Principle eleven: help and improve value chain partners**.
Toyota views itself as in a learning relationship with their partners. It
makes sense because if partners improve their value chain, then that
improves the end-to-end value chain back to the customer.

## Problem Solving

**Principle twelve: PDCA everything**. [Plan-do-check-act][] everything,
everywhere, all the time. Think scientifically about the current
condition and how to reach the target condition. [^6]

[^6]:
    This is a direct reference to [The Toyota Kata][]. I'm happy to
    see Rother's work factored into this book because it wonderful
    distills the mindset.

![PDCA on top of standardized
work](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/PDCA_Process.png)

This means continuous
improvement, or _kaizen_. Standardized work provides the back-stop
for new experiments. Regression is not possible. Instead, emprical results
guide continuous improvements.

**Principle thirteen: align improvement energy of
people through all levels**. Engage people top-down, bottom-up, and
horizontally. Challenge people and give them the autonomy required
rise to the task.

**Principle fourteen: learn your way to the future in
small batches** [^7]. What a lovely principle, right? Experiment your way
forward through constant iterations. Set bold targets then get there
one batch at a time. This connects back to principle one:
adopt long term systems thinking. That provides the time and mindset
to iterate in small batches over years.

[^7]:
    This is why I named my [podcast][small batches] "Small Batches".
    Consistent improvement over time. Get 1% better every day. Results
    compound over time. Working in large batches is more risky and more
    difficult than working in small batches. So reduce the batch size,
    stay small, and keep iterating.

These principles underpin two other Toyota-isms: [The Toyota Production
System][TPS] and the Toyota Business practices.

## Toyota Production System & Toyota Business Practices

You've likely heard of the _Toyota Production System_ (or TPS). That's
their manufacturing process. The _Toyota Business Practices_ (or TPB)
are newer and apply across all of Toyota.

Here is Liker's definition of TPS:

> TPS is Toyota's unique approach to manufacturing and the basis for
> much of the lean production movement that has dominated
> manufacturing and service trends for the last 30 years or more. Led
> by Taiichi Ohno, TPS was constructed in a time of low demand and a
> high need for vareity in Japan, which necessiated a manufacturing
> apporach that allowed for quick changeovers, low inventories, and
> flexibility.
>
> Based on the philosophies of jidoka and just-in-time, TPS can
> effeciently and quickly produce products of sound quality, one at a
> time, that fully statisfy customer requirements.

Basically, it's how Toyota makes cars and why this book even exists.
Toyota would not be Toyota as we know them today without TPS.

Toyota is not immune from growing pains. Their international
growth made it difficult to maintain a coherent culture. Fujio Cho, then
CEO, led the introduction of The Toyota Way (pictured earlier) in 2001.

He realized this was not enough to help employees develop a continuous
improvement mindset and respect for people and processes. He
introduced the Toyota Business Practices as a framework for developing
Toyota Way thinking across the entire company.

This graphic wonderfully summarizes the practices: PDCA guides action
with proper intention. You can see the Toyota Kata applied as well.

## My Thoughts

The stories and alternate explanations of concepts I'd encountered
elsewhere are my favorite part of the book.

Most of my education about Toyota came from indirect sources. So I
figured I'd go straight to the source. The book definitely delivered
on that. This book is 100% Toyota.

The principles did not suprise me but the graphics and explanations of
them did. I really liked the Toyota Way 2001 House. It wonderfully
depicts the philosophy. There's also another graphic of the Toyota
Production System as a PDCA loop overlayed with jidoka and
just-in-time.

I came away with a newfound appreciation for terms I'd encountered
before. The
first is _gemba_ (you may know "gemba walk") and _genchi genbutsu_.

"Gemba" roughly translates to the place the where the work actually
happens.

> [Taiichi] Ohno admonished his students to "observe the production
> floor without preconceptions and with a blank mind. Repeat why five
> times to every matter."

Notice that Ohno says "observe". It's not enough to simply go.
You must observe and study the actual condition.

You must unlearn what you have learned. You cannot approach the gemba
with assumptions. One first admit they do not fully comprehend the
current condition. Thus, going to the _gemba_ is a learning exercise.
First understand the current condition. Then progress toward the
target condition.

There's a wonderful quote somewhere that you cannot learn something
you think you already know. This is similar to a zen saying[^8]:

> "You are like this teacup, so full that nothing more can be added.
> Come back to me when the cup is empty. Come back to me with an empty
> mind."

[^8]:
    I think there is overlap with Zen Buddhism and
    _gemba_ idea. I don't think this is on accident either. I think
    there was a confluence of aspects in Japanese culture and Buddhism
    that led to "The Toyota Way". First Japanese culture tends to take a
    long term view, thinking about one or two generations down the line.
    They're also group oriented and strive exceed in many things.
    Japanese work ethic is legendary. Buddhism encourages people to
    think of the interconnectedness of all beings. Buddhist philosophy
    is more common in Japan than it is in the west. I'm speculating
    here, but this may be why it was so difficult for western companies
    to truly grok The Toyota Way.

    Liker thinks there is a connection as well. He suggests the communal
    nature of rice farming and culture exposure to Buddhism. It turns
    out that Saikichi Toyoda was a Buddhist himself.

The focus on _gemba_ stuck with me, so I applied it in
my work. My practice was to avoid assuming I understood what was
happening or what people were trying to do. Instead I went to the
gemba to see the current condition for myself. Success!

Next comes _genchi genbutsu_. This is the Toyota principle of teaching
by doing directly to the _gemba_ then making correct decisions,
building consensus, and achieving goals.

Both these terms come up over and over again throughout the text. You
can't miss them.

Third is _countermeasures_. Here's a passage from the text:

> The term "countermeasures" is an important one at Toyota. You will
> hear there are no solutions, just countermeasures. These are
> measures that members hypothesize might help counter (reduce) the
> gap between the desired condition and the current condition.
> Measures are tested, and if they help to reduce the gap, they are
> continued until better ones are developed. Proven countermeasures
> lead to standards--the best we know today until we set a better,
> perhaps more challenging, standard.

The passage made me evaluate why I'd taken
certain actions before. [Preflight checks][] are one great example. I
hypothesized that if I had a dry run mode to my application, then
started the app in a dry run mode during the deployment pipeline
before executing a code change, this would reduce errors created from the
combination of configuration and code (i.e. "environment" in the 12
factor app sense). That proved successful in stopping many guaranteed
failed deploys. I've adopted preflight checks as part of my standard
work for years now, and in turn, brought it to any new team I work
with.

The Toyota Way also made me reasses my view on standard work. I had
been missuing the term. The term shows up in the passage on
countermeasures and numerous times throughout the text. At Toyota,
"standard work" means the best way to do things _as we currently
understand_. It's a moving target. Standards will changes as
requirements change and we discover new ways of working and solving
problems.

I think there's hesistancy in adopting "standard work" in
knowledge work (like IT). Detractors see it as means of stifling
people's creative abilities. I don't think that's the case. I consider
the standard guardrails. They are proven formulas. Human creativity is
not needed to complete a standard procedure. Human creativity is
needed to _improve_ the standard. There is a time and place for
standard work just as there is a time for kaizen.

My mistake was miscategorizing "standard work" as "regular work" (or
"business as usual") type work. That is, the things we know we just
have to do by our position. Writing tests is regular work for
developers. There may be (and should be) standard work associated with
that, for example what, where, and how to test specific bits of code.
Human creativity comes to the rescue when there is a new challenge
that does not fit the standard work. I've included a higlighted
passage later on regarding standard work later on in this article.

I did learn something new from the book. In fact, I learned that I
misunderstood a concept entirely. You may have heard that anyone on
the line and pull the Andon coord to stop the line. That was my
understanding until reading this book. That is **not** true. Anyone on
the line can _pull_ the andon coord. A team leader responds to the
andon pull. Their job is review the situtation and decide if the line
should stop.

There are stories in the book about teams adopting the andon coord
without having a team lead come and review. As a result anyone could
stop the line creating chaos. So TIL: an andon pull is like a page;
send to someone else for further action.

## Highlights

Here's a grab bag of higlighted passages.

This is actually a quote from _The High Velocity Edge_. The quote
appears in the chapter on "PDCA Everything". Here's someone reflecting
on their image as a leader and problem solver after years in Toyota:

> Lesson 1. There is no subsitute for direct observation.
>
> Lesson 2. Proposed changes should always be structured as
> experiments.
>
> Lesson 3. Workers and managers experiment as frequently as possible.
>
> Lesson 4. Managers should coach, not fix.

I included this passage because it compresses a 350 page book into four
sentences. Sure it's a lossy compression but it's pretty good.

Here's something different.

> Our primitive brain hates uncertainity and drives us to assume we
> know the right answer or there is a known best way.

This is a great quote for a few reasons. One, it connects to
a principle in Deming's System of Profound Knowledge: understanding of
phsycology. The author didn't include "monkey" before "primitive
brain". That would cut down some of human ego. This leads right into
Daniel Kahneman's work on thinking fast and slow. Our primitive monkey
brains (no slight to monkeys) are great at pattern matching and
applying known solutions. That's fast thinking. Slow thinking requires
reason and analysis. That's much harder to do. The quote conveys the
point that our brains will opt for (likely incorrect) fast thinking
without proper training.

Practices like going to the _genchi genbutsu_ and scientific thinking
are countermeasures to our inate desire to assume we know the answer.
Instead we must discover the correct responses to the challenges
before us.

Leveling work (_heijunka_) is one such challenge. I've been questioning if
there prerequisites for lean processes. In other words can we _just_
start doing this or do we need to get some thing in order first? I
don't have the answer. I'm still exploring that question. This passage
adds some weight to one side of the argument:

> Leveling [heijunka] enables takt (stable rate of demand), which is necessary
> for doing standardized work and balancing work on the line, which is
> a requirement for leveled pull from upstream processes and supplier,
> which leads to minimum inventory, minimum cost, and the best
> quality.

Here's another passage that alludes to a principle of Deming's System
of Profound Knowledge: [understanding variation][variation].

> It is impossible to improve any process until it is standardized. If
> the process is shifting from here to there, then any improvement
> will just be one more variation that will be altered by the next
> variation. One must standardize and thus stablize, the process
> before continuous improvements can be made.

It's as if Liker is just channeling Deming directly from _The New
Economics_. "shifting from here to there" is special cause variation.
"standardizing" refers to removing special cause variation before
doing anything else. "altered by the next variation" is tampering.
Deming dedicates an entire chapter to tampering in _The New
Economics_. This passage reinforces the importance of standardized
work as the requirement and backstop for improvement. So first
standardize and stablize, then improve. This led mt o question the
prerequisites for doing lean.

Here's a passage from a former CEO on the Toyota Business Practices
(TBP) and standardized work. I think this coroborates my position on
standard work.

> The Toyota Business Practices--a standard approach of business
> processes and a common language for all of Toyota. Such a
> standardized approach is not intended to limit an individual's way
> of conducting business. Rather, the standard approach provides a
> basic framework from which the individual can express their unique
> talent.

The following passage presents a different view of _kaizen_. This one
hit me hard. So much so that I neeed to higlight it and
underline it.

> Hansei is really much deeper than reflection. It is really being
> honest about your own weaknesses. If you are talking about only your
> strengths, you are bragging. If you are recognizing your weaknesses
> with sincerity, it is a high level of strength. But it does not end
> there. How do you change to overcome those weaknesses? That is at
> the root of the very notion of kaizen. If you do not understand
> hansei, then kaizen is just continuous improvement. We want to
> overcome areas of weakness.

Damn. That is one of my favorite passages from the book. This type of
thinking shows up time and again in the book. People are always
looking to the deeper meaning of their actions. They're questioning
and looking into philosophy. It's amazing.

Alright, here's the last one.

> Contrary to the notion that lean processes fix problems, the truth
> is they reveal problems and place a higher burden on leaders,
> managers, and team members to keep on improving.

This quote resonated with me because it reveals that leadership is a
real issue. How many times has the responsibility incorrectly fallen
on frontline people when management assumes a new way of working is a
magic bullet that solves all of the problems.
